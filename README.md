# bunchOstuff

To start the application cd into the frontend and the backend folders then run npm install. After that run npm start in both folders.


The bunchOstuff wesbite lets you offer items that you have no need for and give them a second life by giving them to someone else.
This was made using Express with Node, React , material UI and MongoDb.


The websites motto is to offer the earth a better chance to thrive.
We combine two groups of people, one who are giving away items and the other who need them,
creating a simple interaction with a green idea which is better for the environment and user friendly for all ages.
In doing so, the product often becomes more valuable through reutilizing it.
